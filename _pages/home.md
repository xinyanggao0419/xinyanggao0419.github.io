Hi, my name is Xinyang Gao (高欣扬) — welcome to my personal website.

I'm currently a Master of Engineering student in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University. This website serves as a portfolio of my academic background, professional interests, and selected data analytics projects. You’ll find information about my experience, research and coursework, as well as some of the tools and ideas I’ve explored along the way.

You can navigate to the following sections:

- **About Me** – A brief personal and academic introduction.
- **CV** – My full CV and relevant experience.
- **Projects** – Data analytics projects and applied work in modeling and statistics.
- **Misc** – Exploratory work, tools, side notes, and other data-related materials that don’t fit into formal categories.

I'm passionate about using data to drive decision-making and uncover patterns in complex systems, and I hope some of the work here sparks your interest.
