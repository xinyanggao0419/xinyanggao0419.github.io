This section serves as a repository for various materials and thoughts that do not fall under the primary categories of this site, but may still be of interest.

* Tools & Snippets
  * `pandas_profiling` vs. `sweetviz`: A Comparison
    Brief notes on pros/cons for exploratory data analysis reports.

  * SQL Snippets for Faster Window Functions 
    Handy syntax patterns I revisit often for analytics queries.
  
  * Reusable Python Functions for Data Cleaning
    Custom wrappers for common `pandas` operations I’ve standardized across projects.

* Notes & Observations
  * Reflections on the limitations of A/B testing in small-scale deployments.  
  * When not to trust a p-value: lessons from synthetic datasets.  
  * How I use Jupyter + VS Code for maintaining clean data notebooks.

This section is updated occasionally as I explore new datasets, try new libraries, or reflect on analytical practices that don’t quite warrant a full write-up.
