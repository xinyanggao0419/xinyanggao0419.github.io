My name is Xinyang Gao (高欣扬), and I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering degree at [School of Enginnering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/), [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), majoring in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration from [School of Management and Economics](https://sme.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en), with a major in Financial Engineering.

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of data, technology, and decision-making. Specifically, I am passionate about topics such as industrial digitalization, large-scale data modeling, and data-driven business analytics. I enjoy leveraging statistical methods, machine learning techniques, and optimization tools to solve real-world problems across various domains.

During my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in both quantitative modeling and practical data processing. My recent work involves applying big data technologies to extract insights from complex datasets, streamline operational processes, and support data-informed strategy development.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy working on data-centric side projects, exploring new analytics tools, and staying current with industry trends in digital transformation and intelligent systems.

Feel free to explore my projects and writings on this website!
